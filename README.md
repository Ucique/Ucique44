# UCIQUE Home â€” Minimal Runner

This packages your existing `UciqueHome.jsx` **unchanged** and adds just enough to run it locally or deploy.

## Run locally
```bash
npm i
npm run dev
```
Open the URL shown in the terminal.

## Build for production
```bash
npm run build
```
Deploy the `dist/` folder (e.g., Netlify Drag & Drop) or use `vercel` CLI.
